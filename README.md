## Key Features

- **Migration Readiness Assessment**: Evaluates your current IT setup to determine cloud readiness, compatibility issues, estimated costs, and potential migration challenges.
- **Automated Migration Planning**: Creates detailed migration plans with step-by-step instructions, resource allocation, and timelines based on the initial assessment.
- **Data Migration Support**: Offers tools for efficient data transfer and synchronization with GCP services like Cloud Storage and BigQuery.
- **Application Containerization Assistance**: Guides you through containerizing applications for GCP's Kubernetes Engine and Cloud Run.
- **Network and Security Configuration**: Helps configure network settings and security measures in GCP for a secure migration.
- **Integration with GCP Migration Services**: Complements existing GCP migration tools like Migrate for Compute Engine and Database Migration Service.
- **Post-Migration Optimization**: Provides recommendations for cost-saving, performance improvements, and further optimization after migration.
- **Real-Time Monitoring and Reporting**: Monitors the migration process in real-time with detailed reporting capabilities.
- **Rollback Features**: Offers robust rollback options to minimize downtime and data loss in case of migration issues.
- **User Training and Documentation**: Includes comprehensive documentation and training modules for effective tool utilization.
